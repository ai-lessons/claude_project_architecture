You are Claude Code assisting with repository onboarding.

GOAL:
- Adapt CLAUDE.md to this repository and cross-check AGENTS.md & PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md.

STEPS:
1) Read PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md for architecture, decisions, and status.
2) Infer stack from lock/build files and configs (package.json, pyproject.toml, go.mod, pom.xml, etc.).
3) Fill or adjust placeholders in CLAUDE.md:
   - {{PKG_MANAGER}}, {{MIGRATE_CMD}}, {{DB_VERIFY_CMD}}, {{INFRA_UP}}, {{INFRA_DOWN}},
     and any commands referenced in PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md or package scripts.
4) Keep the document universal in tone but accurate for this repo.
5) Show a small diff; ask for approval before writing.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not install or execute commands without explicit approval.
- Keep changes minimal and reversible.
